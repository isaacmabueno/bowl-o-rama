**"BOWL-O-RAMA": CODING CHALLENGE FOR NEXTCAPITAL**
**SUMMARY:** This is a coding challenge for NextCapital. Bowl-O-Rama is a single page Application built in Angular. The application pulls from a RESTful JSON API (provided).

**PURPOSE:** The purpose of the app is to provide a simple way for a bowling league to track a progressive jackpot. Bowlers in the league can buy tickets to enter the drawing. All tickets cost $10 dollars, and the proceeds go into the jackpot. After some tickets are bought, one ticket is drawn at random. The owner of that ticket gets to roll once. If they get a strike, they win the entire pot. Otherwise, they win a fraction of the pot, and the remaining pot rolls over into the next drawing.

**HOW THE WEBSITE WORKS:** The page is simple with complex elements, which is a primary character found in the flavor of Present Tense beers. 

**TECHNOLOGIES USED:** HTML5, CSS3 (Bootstrap), RESTful API, JAVASCRIPT, JQUERY
